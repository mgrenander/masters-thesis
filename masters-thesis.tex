\begin{abstract}
The progression of technology and the Internet has allowed us to create and share information at an unprecedented rate.
The usefulness of summarization systems to intelligently condense text has become apparent as a method to sift through the vast amount of text we encounter each day.
Summarization systems typically follow one of two approaches.
In abstractive summarization, the system generates a summary token-by-token, whereas in the extractive approach, the system is tasked with selecting snippets of text from the source document -- typically sentences -- that best represent the text.
Extractive summarization systems have recently been shown to exhibit a bias towards selecting content from an article's lead sentences, even when these sentences are completely irrelevant to the overall text. \parencite{kedzie2018content}.
We investigate this phenomenon in detail, showing that when articles' sentence order is permuted, state-of-the-art systems cannot recover the same performance.
We then propose a solution to this problem, an auxiliary objective function which encourages the model to look beyond a document's leading sentences and properly value each sentence.
We show that adding this auxiliary objective results in significant improvements in performance, particularly in cases where the article's leading sentences constitute a poor summary.
We extend this approach to a novel summarization method that classifies documents with a strong lead vs. a weak lead, and having separate systems summarize the two cases.
We show that this approach is promising, though more work is needed in classifying articles in this way accurately.
