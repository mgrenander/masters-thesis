\textbf{Natural Language Processing} (NLP) is a growing subfield of artificial intelligence that aims to design systems able to understand and respond to human language. Many NLP tasks remain unsolved, reflecting the vast complexity of human language.

Among the unsolved problems, \textbf{text summarization} is primarily concerned with creating systems able to create concise summaries of various text sources. Summarization systems typically follow one of two approaches. \textbf{Abstractive} summarizers generate summaries token-by-token, requiring the system to both understand the text in depth and produce a grammatical summary. 
On the other hand, \textbf{extractive} summarizers create summaries by selecting relevant text spans -- usually sentences -- from the source document.
This thesis will focus on analyzing and improving the extractive approach, particularly in the news domain.

        \textbf{Article:} \hl{Bangladesh beat fellow World Cup quarter-finalists Pakistan by 79 runs in the first one-day international in Dhaka. Tamim Iqbal and Mushfiqur Rahim scored centuries as Bangladesh made 329 for six and Pakistan could only muster 250 in reply. Pakistan will have the chance to level the three-match series on Sunday when the second ODI takes place in Mirpur.} Bangladesh elected to bat after winning the toss but struggled to 67 for two in the 20th over after Soumya Sarkar was run out by Wahab Riaz for 20 and Mahmudullah was bowled by Rahat Ali. Tamim and Mushfiqur set about repairing Bangladesh's stuttering innings and did just that by putting on 178 runs in 21.4 overs for the third wicket, during which time Tamim notched his fifth ODI century. He continued to plunder runs with ease but went for one big shot too many against Wahab and was caught at mid-off to leave Bangladesh on 245 for three with nine overs left. His 135-ball knock of 132 included 15 fours and three sixes. Two sixes in the 43rd over took Mushfiqur into the nineties and he joined Iqbal in passing three figures by hitting Saeed Ajmal for successive fours in the 45th. Mushfiqur perished in the 48th over when he edged Wahab behind to depart for a 77-ball innings of 106 which included 13 fours and two sixes. Shakib al Hasan and Sabbir Rahman scored 30 runs in 2.2 overs before falling to Wahab (four for 59) in the final over as the hosts set pakistan 330 for victory. Azhar Ali and Sarfraz Ahmed put on 53 runs for the first wicket before the latter slog-swept Arafat Sunny to deep backward square leg to leave Pakistan one down in the 11th over. Mohammad Hafeez was then run out to leave Pakistan stuttering on 59 for two but there was some respite when Azhar notched his fifth ODI half-century in the 20th over to celebrate his first match as captain in fine style.\\ \hline

        \textbf{Article}: Standing up for what you believe. What does it cost you? What do you gain? Memories Pizza in the Indiana town of Walkerton is finding out. \hl{The family-run restaurant finds itself at the center of the debate over the state's religious freedom restoration act after its owners said they'd refuse to cater a same-sex couple's wedding.} ``If a gay couple was to come and they wanted us to bring pizzas to their wedding, we'd have to say no'', Crystal O'Connor told CNN affiliate WBND-TV in South Bend. The statement struck at the heart of fears by critics, who said the new law would allow businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians. They called for boycotts. But supporters also rallied. And by the end of the week, they had donated more than \$842,000 for the business. Social media unloaded on the pizzeria in the community of 2,100 people that few folks outside northern Indiana knew existed before this week. riskyliberal tweeted : ``Dear \#memoriespizza. no. My boycotting your business because I don't like your religious bigotry is not a violation of your freedom to practice your religion.'' ``Don't threaten \#memoriespizza'' tweeted aáƒ¦anda. ``Just mock them for their ignorance.'' Bad reviews flooded the restaurant's Facebook page, most having little to do with the quality of the food. Many too vulgar to share. ``Do you really want to financially support a company that treats some of your fellow citizens like second class citizens? Boycott memories pizza!!'' said Rob Katz of Indianapolis. ``Let's hope they either rethink their policy or the free market puts them out of business.'' But \hl{one outburst in particular shut down the restaurant Wednesday and was expected to do the same Thursday.} ``Who's going to Walkerton with me to burn down Memories Pizza?'' Jessica Dooley of Goshen tweeted, according to the Walkerton police department. The account has been deleted since the tweet was posted. Detectives who investigated have recommended charges of harassment, intimidation and threats, according to Charles Kulp, assistant police chief. \\ \hline
