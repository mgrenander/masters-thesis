In this paper, we have presented the first 
approaches for learning a summarization system 
by countering the strong effect of summary-worthy 
lead sentences. We demonstrate that recent 
summarization systems over-exploit the inherent 
lead bias present in news articles, to the 
detriment of their summarization capabilities. 
We explore two techniques aimed at learning to 
better balance positional cues with semantic ones.
While our auxiliary loss method achieves 
significant improvement, we note that there is 
a large gap which better methods can
hope to bridge in the future.

One approach, building on ours, is to examine 
other ways to combine loss signals \parencite{maml}, 
and to encourage exploration \parencite{sac}. 
We will also carry out deeper study of the properties 
of \Dearly{} and \Dlate{} type 
documents and use them to inform new solutions. 
On cursory analysis, the most frequent terms in 
\Dearly{} tend to be about UK politics, while 
in \Dlate{} they are often related to British soccer.
